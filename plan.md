# Time Estimation Using Bucket System

We have elected not to estimate how long each function will take (in days), since it'll make our development process inflexible and we most likely will estimate incorrectly due to both our inexperience and the sheer scope of the project.

Instead we have utilised the Bucket System to estimate the general scope of our project.
Each bucket is represented by a column in the table, who's number corresponds to a theoretical range of time. The tasks are gathered from our user stories and remaining functions from the specifications. As we are not sure about the specifications of some functions, such as the private channel functionality and resetting the password, the length of each task may vary from the estimated time.

After careful consideration regarding what functions are dependent on others and how long they may take, we will be implementing the functions in the following order:

	* Register
	* Login
	* Logout 
	* Reset password
	* Display profile
	* Upload photo
	* Create channels
	* Channel invites
	* Channel add owner
	* Channel permission change
	* Channel leave 
	* Channel details
	* List all channels
	* Channel join 
	* Send message 
	* See last 50 messages
	* Message react
	* Message pin 
	* Schedule message
	* Message edit
	* Delete message
	* Private channel functionality
	* Search messages
	* Standup functions
	* Edit user attributes

For iteration 2 we'll be mainly using the Scrum framework, which involves dividing our function implementation into sprints. The sprints will go in the order: 

1. auth_functions 
1. channel_functions
1. message_functions
1. standup_functions

These sprints will typically last 3-5 days depending on the difficulty (as estimated by our logical buckets). 

At the beginning of each sprint we will go over the functionalities we wish to implement for the sprint and have daily 15 minute standups allowing us to check our progress on each assigned task. These standups will be held every morning to ensure all members get the rest of the day to tackle their assigned tasks.

Since this our first sprint using the Scrum framework, having group evaluations at the end of each sprint is necessary to improve the effectiveness of our group. 

# Software

For the duration of iteration 2, we'll be mainly using Slack to plan and communicate within our group as this poses 2 major benefits:
	* More familiarity with the Slack interface and functions to translate over to the project
	* Slack is more suited to organising group projects than traditional messaging software (e.g. Facebook)

For our daily 15 minute standups, we will be utilising Discord as meeting up in person daily is unreasonable, due to how far we live away from each other.
