# Reflection

Within a few days of the assignment release, our group started reading and thinking about how to approach the assignment. We discussed the structure of our procedure and debriefed each others on how to write stub functions and our general approach to testing to ensure consistency in our code style. 

Since our group gitlab was set up a few days after the assignment release, we decided to create a temporary gitlab repository and began working on the project. It was easy to port these files over once the gitlab was set up.

Our group consisted of 4 people, so when delegating tasks, we split into groups of 2, where one pair started focusing on writing user stories and the other two started coding some stub functions and tests. 

The user stories were based primarily on the requirements video and briefly discussed as a group. Some complications we had whilst writing user stories was that when we first started, we had based our stories on the actual version of Slack which contains some features such as live updates and message threads, which UNSW decided not to imitate. After realising this, we had a group meeting and reviewed the appropriate requirements that had to be included. This consisted of rewriting our epics to make them more relevant and changing our user stories, which had previously been too superfluous, instead making them more simple and appropriate for the requirements. Once the user stories were finalised, the other two members proceeded to help the implementation of the stub functions. 

As a group, everyone had responsibilities to check and upvote merge requests, or discuss them on our group Slack workspace before they could be successfully merged into the master branch, ultimately ensuring that the master remained in a stable condition without any conflicts. 

Our methods of communication involved weekly group meetings and also online via our personal Slack workspace. By using Slack, the program that we were ultimately trying to imitate, we gained a greater understanding of how the program works. We also agreed on weekly meetups in which we reviewed the progress of everyone's implementation of stub functions and tests. Within each session, we presented everything we had done individually as well as everything we did by the end of the session to ensure no one was falling behind on the project. 

During our most recent meeting, we planned and contrived method(s) we could potentially use in future iterations.  

One main obstacle we faced during iteration 1 was that we should have delegated our tasks from the beginning. When we started, after splitting into 2 groups, each member could just choose which function they wanted to implement and test, which was too lenient and did not offer enough direction for the members and members spent too long on each individual function. This could have been fast-tracked by allocating functions to each member, so that they have a set number of tasks to complete. 

Overall, iteration 1 was completed smoothly and according to schedule due to sufficient organisation and frequent of individual check-ups. As a group, we believed that the problems encountered throughout this iteration were tackled in a collaborative manner and the work was distributed fairly to ensure maximum contribution from each group member. Hence, we successfully operated as a well-functioning and coordinated team
